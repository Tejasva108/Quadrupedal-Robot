# Quadrupedal-Robot

# üêæ Quadruped Robot using ROS 2 & micro-ROS

## üìò Overview
This project involves the development of a **quadruped robot** with **3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF)** per leg, driven by **12 high-torque servo motors**. The robot integrates **ROS 2** (on Raspberry Pi) and **micro-ROS** (on ESP32) for distributed communication and control. The aim is to design a modular and semi-autonomous robotic platform capable of operating in agricultural environments for field inspection and plant health monitoring.

## üöú Agricultural Application
This quadruped robot is designed for **agricultural field inspection and monitoring**.  
The workflow includes:
1. Robot traverses crop fields using waypoints (autonomous/semi-autonomous navigation)
2. Captures images of plants using the onboard camera
3. Fuses GPS data to map the exact location of captured images
4. Images are analyzed using a machine le
